- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for API and file serving
- **Audio Processing**: FFmpeg for format conversion and metadata handling
- **Storage**: File system with JSON for favorites/metadata
- **Icons**: Microsoft Fluent UI System Icons

## üìã Requirements

- **Node.js** 16+ 
- **NPM** or **Yarn**
- **FFmpeg** (automatically installed via ffmpeg-static)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Install
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd soundboard
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Paths
Edit `public/config.json` to set your desired paths:
```json
{
    "soundEffectDirFilePath": "<full_file_path_to_folder>",
    "stateDataFilePath": "<full_file_path_to_favorites.json>"
}
```

### 3. Create Required Directories
```bash
# Create the sound effects directory
mkdir -p <fp_for_dir_to_save_and_read_sounds>

# Create the user storage directory  
mkdir -p <fp_to_user_storage_folder>
```

### 4. Start the Server
```bash
npm start
```

### 5. Access Pulse Bin
Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:3000`

### Required Files and Directories

| Path | Type | Purpose | Auto-created? |
|------|------|---------|---------------|
| Sound effects directory | Directory | Stores all audio files | ‚úÖ Yes (on first upload) |
| User storage directory | Directory | Contains favorites.json | ‚úÖ Yes (when needed) |
| favorites.json | File | Stores favorite status | ‚úÖ Yes (when first favorite is set) |

### Default Paths

If `config.json` is missing or invalid, Pulse Bin falls back to:
- **Sound effects**: `./sfx/` (relative to project root)
- **Favorites**: `./user_storage/favorites.json`

## üéØ Self-Hosting Guide
